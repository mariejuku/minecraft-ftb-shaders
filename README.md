Minecraft shader properties for FTB

There are many shader packs for Minecraft, and they typically apply visual changes only to vanilla Minecraft blocks. We can change this though.
On this site is a tool that makes it easier to update the *block.properties* file of a Minecraft shader pack, in order to support mods and mod packs in a reusable way.

| *Mod* |↔| *mapping table* |↔| *Shader*|
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ↑Add mods↑ | | | | ↑add shaders↑ |

The tool links maps and shaders such that any supported mod will work with any supported shader.
It can then make a block.properties file that can replace the original shader's block.properties and thereby add all of the mod's new blocks.
